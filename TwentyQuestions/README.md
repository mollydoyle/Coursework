Repository for my final project for Intro to Engineering Systems II. 
I worked with 3 other students to create a Twenty Questions simulation game which functions by prompting the user to answer “yes or no” questions about birds to guess what bird the user is thinking of from a library of information about 293 bird species. A list of 60 imported characteristics was used as a basis of the 60 possible  “yes or no” questions. During the testing and experimental stage, each question was asked as the first question at least once, and on each round, the subsequent questions were determined using a function that finds the most efficient next question. The efficiency of each next question was based on which respective characteristic contains the most variance between the birds. After determining the leading and following questions which lead to the most efficent results, the algorithim continuously asked questions based on this order to reduce the amount of possible birds that the user may be thinking of until it accurately guesses the user’s bird.
