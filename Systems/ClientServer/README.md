## Members

- Molly Doyle (mdoyle22@nd.edu)
- Chase Saca (csaca@nd.edu)

* Demonstration Video

* We noticed that in some of the videos in our powerpoint, the words are hard to see, since the Zoom recording has a low resolution.
* Below is the link to our powerpoint, which contains all of the videos that we showed, where you can better view the embedded videos if necessary.

## Errata

* We successfully completed all activities of the project, including the two programs thor and spidey, the experiments, the guru points, and the video.  
* All tests, including test_spidey, test_thor, and valgrind, pass completely with no errors or memory leakages

## Contributions

* We each took the lead on different files 
    * Chase: src/handler.c, src/forking.c, src/utils.c, src/spidey.c, experiment scripts, virtual private server 
    * Molly: Makefile, src/request.c, src/single.c, src/socket.c, bin/thor.py, web programming guru points
* We both made correctness and defect checks, including fixing errors, with the test scripts and valgrind
* We both completed experiment analysis, made the powerpoint, and filmed the demonstration video
