This repository contains code which built skill in managing dynamic memory in C by creating fundamental data structures (contained in the src repository) and navigating a file system using low-level functions and system calls. This was accomplished by building a hash table library and using this library to build a duplicates utility which determines if there are any duplicate files by computing the checksum of each argument.
